.. rubric:: Introduction
   :name: introduction-linux-uniflash-qsg

This document describes a process to program Flash memory (NAND, NOR,
SPI, QSPI and eMMC) attached to a TI AM335x or AM437x processor on a
production target board. This is possible using either the Ethernet
interface or the USB device interface available on the AMxxxx SoC
connected to a host PC. This document is intended to guide those that
want to program the flash memory on new boards for production.

The overall process is broken into two parts:

#. Developing the images to both be programmed and do the programming
   from the AM335x or AM437x SoC. This is usually done by the Linux
   developer responsible for creating the images. This process is
   documented
   `here <../../Foundational_Components/Tools/Flash_Tools.html#am335x-am437x-flash-programming>`__.
#. Actually programming the images using Uniflash v3. This tool runs on
   a Windows PC and serves the images to the target board that is being
   programmed. This process is detailed below.

.. rubric:: Overview
   :name: overview-uniflash

Uniflash is one part of an overall system that includes the Windows PC
on which Uniflash runs, a target board including an AM335x/AM437x Sitara
Processor and flash memory to be programmed, and a USB or Ethernet
connection between the two. It is assumed that the flash on the target
board is blank, or needs to be overwritten. Therefore, the target board
has nothing that it can execute except the bootloader stored in the ROM
on the AM335x/AM437x SoC. So, the ROM bootloader will use either USB or
Ethernet to request files served by Uniflash on the Host PC and once
transferred, executed on the target board. The below diagram should
help.

.. Image:: /images/Flash_programming_block_diagram.png

In the above diagram, take notice of the files stored on the PC. There
are really 2 different images that will be used:

#. The image to write the flash on the target board, which is composed
   of the SPL, U-Boot, and debrick or flasher files indicated. These
   will be pulled over by the bootloader in ROM when the target board is
   powered on (assuming the boot settings are set up to boot from USB or
   Ethernet).
#. The image to be written. This is shown as "Image" and is pulled over
   from the Host PC. Once on the target, it will be broken up and
   written to the appropriate places in flash as determined by the
   flasher program above (mainly by the debrick or flasher script). This
   image will also likely contain a SPL and U-Boot, as well as a Kernel
   (zImage) and Root Filesystem. This is the image that will execute out
   of flash once it has been written and will vary depending the needs
   of the target board.

.. rubric:: Using Uniflash to Program Flash Images
   :name: using-uniflash-to-program-flash-images

Once the images to be programmed into perpetual memory have been
developed, an environment can be set up to program these images. This
process involves a Client/Server type setup where a host PC serves as
the server and the target board based on the AM335x/AM437x SoC serves as
the client. The connection between the two can either be USB or Ethernet
based. Since the USB protocol supported is Remote NDIS (or RNDIS
hereafter), which is network (TCP/IP) based similar to Ethernet, both
processes will be fairly similar.

In either configuration, the host PC provides the following services to
the target through the Uniflash tool:

-  BOOTP Server – to provide an IP address and image name based on the
   Vendor ID requested by the AM335x/AM437x ROM code
-  DHCP Server – to provide an IP address to the target
-  TFTP Server – to serve up images located on the host PC as they are
   requested by the target board
-  GUI - friendly GUI environment for configuration and status

.. rubric:: Host PC Setup
   :name: host-pc-setup

Here are some step by step instructions to configure a setup to flash
target boards using a Windows PC. These steps were validated using
Windows 7, however the steps should be similar for other versions of
Windows.

.. rubric:: Install Uniflash
   :name: install-uniflash

Uniflash is a tool provided by Texas Instruments that supports multiple
platforms and flash configurations. Support for Sitara devices was added
in Uniflash version 3.0 and beyond.

#. Download Uniflash v3 `here <http://processors.wiki.ti.com/index.php/Category:CCS_UniFlash>`__.
#. Extract the downloaded .zip archive to a temporary folder.
#. Execute the Uniflash Setup program, uniflash\_setup\_3.3.0.00058.
#. Click **Next** to accept the terms of the license agreement.
#. Click **Next** to install into the default directory, c:\\ti, or
   **Browse** to install somewhere else.
#. Select **Custom** under type of Setup and click **Next**.

.. image:: /images/Uniflashv3_setup_custom.png

#. Select **Sitara AMxxxx processors** and click **Next**.

.. image:: /images/Uniflashv3_setup_sitara.png

#. Verify that **Sitara Flash Connection Support** is checked.

.. image:: /images/Uniflashv3_setup_sitara_flash_connection.png

#. Click **Next** to verify your choices.
#. Wait while Uniflash installs.
#. Choose what options you'd like to have to start Uniflash (place on
   desktop, quick start, etc.)
#. Uniflash is now installed and you should see something like this:

.. rubric:: Preparing to Flash a Target Board
   :name: preparing-to-flash-a-target-board

Now that Uniflash is installed, we need to make sure that it knows how
to serve up the files needed to flash a target board. It needs to know
where these files are located and how to send them to the target via
either USB or Ethernet.

Here are the options for the Flash Servers Configuration that need to be
properly set up:

-  Network Interface IP - IP address that the Host Computer will use.
   Needs to correspond to the values used below to set up the Network
   Interface. The default value, 192.168.2.1, should be fine for most
   environments as it is a local IP Address.
-  IP Lease - Amount of time an IP Address given to a target board is
   held for.
-  DHCP IP Range Low - Low IP address in a range that will be given to a
   target board. Must be on the same subnet as the Network Interface IP
   of the Host Computer.
-  DHCP IP Range High - High IP address in a range that will be given to
   a target board. Must be on the same subnet as the Network Interface
   IP of the Host Computer.
-  TFTP Server IP - Should be the same as the Network Interface IP of
   the Host Computer.
-  TFTP home folder - Folder on the host computer where the files to be
   served to the target board are located.
-  Control Port - Socket used to allow the GUI to interact with servers.
   Should not be changed.

Given these definitions, set the values in Uniflash to match your
environment. **Note: that in most instances the default values should be
fine and are recommended.**

You must place the files to be served by the host PC to the target board
in the TFTP home folder directory above. In most cases, you should have
been given the below files to serve to the target board by the linux
development team (these files can vary and are just an example):

-  MLO or SPL
-  A U-boot image
-  A kernel image (if using a Linux kernel for flashing) and associated
   Device Tree file
-  debrick.scr or flasher.sh
-  Flash Image files (contains the images to be flashed on the target
   board)

.. rubric:: AM437x Additional Setup
   :name: am437x-additional-setup

If you are using an AM437x device you the target board to be flashed,
there are a couple of extra steps in order to pair Uniflash with the
AM437x ROM code.

-  After installing Uniflash, open the opendhcp.cfg file under the
   install directory, in the third\_party\\sitara folder using a text
   editor like Notepad.
-  Add the two lines below to the [VENDOR\_ID\_TO\_BOOTFILE\_MAP]
   section toward the top of the file:

   -  AM43xx ROM=u-boot-spl-restore.bin
   -  AM43xx U-B=u-boot-restore.img

**Note:The 10 characters before the "=" must be exact as this is what is
sent from the ROM code to request the next file in the flash procedure.
The "x's" in the AM43xx part are lower-case.**

.. rubric:: Flashing a Board using Ethernet
   :name: flashing-a-board-using-ethernet

To program a board using the Ethernet interface between the Host PC and
the target board, a private network between the two will be established.
The HOST PC is set up with a Static IP address on one NIC (Network
Interface Card) and connected to an ethernet switch or directly to the
target board. A router that assigns IP addresses should not be used as
the host PC needs to provide this to boot the target board.

Here is what you will need:

-  Host PC with Uniflash installed and an available ethernet port.
-  The files used to program the board put in the TFTP home folder set
   up in Uniflash.
-  2 ethernet cables if using a switch and one if using a direct
   connection.
-  Ethernet switch (optional). **Note: This should not be a router, as
   the host PC needs to provide IP addresses.**
-  Target board(s) to be programmed.

| Here is an example of the different connections in this set up.

.. Image:: /images/Ethernet_block_diagram.png

#. If Uniflash is not already running on the Host PC, start it.
#. **Click** on **New Target Configuration**.

.. Image:: /images/UniFlash_new_target_configuration.png

#. Set **Connection** to **Sitara Flash Connections** and **Board or
   Device** to **Sitara Flash Devices**. Click **OK**.

.. Image:: /images/Uniflash_Create_CCXML_File.png

#. Make sure the **Flash Server Configuration** is set up properly.

.. Image:: /images/UniFlash_flash_server_configuration.png

#. Connect the Host PC to the network switch (or directly to the target
   board if using a direct connection).
#. **Click** on the **Open Network and Sharing Center**.

.. Image:: /images/Open_network_sharing_center.png

#. **Click** on the Local Area Connection that corresponds to the
   ethernet connection. If you only have one, it should be the only one
   listed.

.. Image:: /images/Internet_connection.png

#. In the Connection Dialog, **Click** on **Properties**.

.. Image:: /images/Local_Area_Connection_Status.png

#. Select **Internet Protocol Version 4 (TCP/IPv4)** and choose
   **Properties**.

.. Image:: /images/Tcpipv4_properties.png

#. Set the port to use a Static IP Address by selecting **Use the
   following IP Address:** and changing the **IP Address:** to
   192.168.2.1. This setting should correspond to the **Network
   Interface IP** setting in Uniflash.

.. Image:: /images/Ip_address.png

#. Verify that the **Subnet Mask** is set to 255.255.255.0 and click
   **OK**.
#. Click **Close**.

.. Image:: /images/Local_Area_Connection_Properties_close.png

#. Click **Close** one more time to get back to the Network Manager.

.. Image:: /images/Local_Area_Connection_Status_close.png

#. **Close** Network Manager if you'd like as it should no longer be
   needed. The network is now set up.
#. In Uniflash, enable the flashing capability by clicking on **Start
   Flashing**.

.. Image:: /images/Uniflash_start_flashing.png

#. Depending on your Windows Firewall settings, you may get the below
   two warnings for the servers being used (opendhcp and opentftp). If
   so, please click **Allow access** for both.

.. Image:: /images/Windows_Security_Alert_opendhcp.png

.. Image:: /images/Windows_Security_Alert_opentftp.png

#. Make sure the target board is powered and connect it via ethernet to
   the network switch (or directly).
#. If everything is working correctly, the flashing process should start
   automatically on the board. You should see status feedback appear in
   Uniflash as the process progresses.

.. image:: /images/UniFlash_status_start.png

| Until it completes:

.. image:: /images/UniFlash_status_done.png

.. note::

   The time the process takes to complete will vary considerably
   depending on a number of factors: the amount of data to be
   transferred to the target, the speed of the interface between the
   host and the target, the amount of data to be flashed, the write
   speed of the memory to be programmed, etc.

#. To flash another target board, simply make a connection between it
   and the host PC through the switch. The board should start flashing
   automatically if powered and connected properly.

.. rubric:: Flashing a Board using USB
   :name: flashing-a-board-using-usb

To program a board using the USB interface between the host PC and the
target board, the RNDIS protocol will be used to create a network
connection over USB. A private network between the two will be
established. The host PC is set up with a static IP address on one USB
interface that ends up looking like a dedicated NIC (Network Interface
Card) and connected directly to the target board.

Here is what you will need:

-  Host PC with Uniflash installed and an available USB port.
-  The files used to program the board put in the TFTP home folder as
   set up in Uniflash.
-  A appropriate USB cable to connect the host PC and target board.
-  Target board to be programmed.

| Here is an example of the different connections in this set up:

.. Image:: /images/Usb_block_diagram.png

In order to establish a USB based RNDIS connection between the host and
target, an appropriate driver needs to be installed on the host. A RNDIS
driver is provided with Windows. This driver needs to be associated with
2 different steps in the flashing process and may have to be installed
multiple times. Essentially, as the Sitara Processor on the target board
moves through different stages of flashing process, it looks like a
different USB device to Windows and the driver may need to be associated
for each step. If it is not, that particular stage in the process will
not be able to communicate over RNDIS and the process will fail.

This driver association should be handled automatically for AM335x. For
AM43xx devices, this is a more manual process documented below. Either
way, these steps could provide helpful information for either devices if
problems are encountered.

#. If Uniflash is not already running on the host PC, start it.
#. **Click** on **New Target Configuration**.

.. Image:: /images/UniFlash_new_target_configuration.png

#. Set **Connection** to **Sitara Flash Connections** and **Board or
   Device** to **Sitara Flash Devices**. Click **OK**.

.. Image:: /images/Uniflash_Create_CCXML_File.png

#. Make sure the **Flash Server Configuration** is set up properly.

.. Image:: /images/UniFlash_flash_server_configuration.png

#. Connect the host PC to the powered target board using an appropriate
   USB cable.
#. This will prompt Windows to install a USB driver if a target board
   has never been plugged into that particular PC and that particular
   USB port on that PC. More than likely for the AM437x devices, this
   attempt will fail.

.. image:: /images/Usb_driver_didnt_install.png

#. Use Device Manager to install a USB driver. To open Device Manager,
   click on **Start --> All Programs --> Right Click on Computer and
   Select Properties**.

.. image:: /images/Open_device_manager.png

#. Click on Device Manager in the window that opens.

.. image:: /images/Device_manager.png

#. Find the **AM43xx1.2** Device listed in “Other Devices” per below. It
   will have a little yellow exclamation point on it indicating there is
   currently a problem with the device. **Right click** on it and select
   **Update Driver Software…**.

.. image:: /images/Am43xx_device_properties.png

.. note::

   If the device is not listed, it is probably because the
   operation has already timed out. Simply power cycle the target board
   to restart the process.

#. In the Update Driver Software dialog, choose **Browse my computer for
   driver software**.

.. image:: /images/Update_USB_Driver_search.png

#. Click **Let me pick from a list** in the next window:

.. image:: /images/Update_Driver_Software_pick.png

#. Choose **Network Adapter** and click **Next**:

.. image:: /images/RNDIS_network_adapter.png

#. Choose **Microsoft Corporation** as the Manufacturer and **Remote
   NDIS6 based Device** under adapter. Click **Next**:

.. image:: /images/RNDIS_network_adapter_RNDIS.png

#. If you see the following warning, click **Yes**:

.. image:: /images/RNDIS_network_adapter_warning.png

#. You should receive a confirmation like below when the driver is
   successfully installed. Finally click **Close**.:

.. image:: /images/RNDIS_network_adapter_success.png

#. When the USB Driver for RNDIS is properly installed, it will create a
   new network interface. This can typically be seen in the lower
   right-hand corner of the toolbar:

   .. Image:: /images/New_network_connection.png

#. This new interface needs to be configured with a static IP address.
   **Click** on the Networking icon in the toolbar, and then click on
   the **Open Network and Sharing Center** link.

   .. Image:: /images/Open_network_sharing_center.png

#. Inside the Network and Sharing Center, click on the new Internet
   Connection:

   .. Image:: /images/Internet_connection_2.png

   **Note: The number next to the “Local Area Connection” will depend on
   the number of network connections the computer has. If this is the
   only network connection (i.e. the computer does not have an Ethernet
   or wireless networking connection), then this would be “1”. In most
   cases, computers have either a wired or wireless connection that will
   take up spot #1. Therefore, the new USB RNDIS Network Connection will
   be #2. However, if the computer has multiple connections already,
   then this number could be higher.**
#. In the Connection Dialog, **Click** on **Properties**.

   .. Image:: /images/Local_area_connection_2_properties.png

#. Select **Internet Protocol Version 4 (TCP/IPv4)** and choose
   **Properties**.

   .. Image:: /images/Tcpipv4_properties.png

#. Set the port to use a Static IP Address by selecting **Use the
   following IP Address:** and changing the **IP Address:** to
   192.168.2.1. This setting should correspond to the **Network
   Interface IP** setting in Uniflash. Verify that the **Subnet Mask**
   is set to 255.255.255.0 and click **OK**.

   .. Image:: /images/Ip_address.png

   **Note: It is possible to use other IP addresses. However, the IP
   address used needs to match the Uniflash configuration. If you prefer
   to use another address, you will need to change those configurations
   as well.**
#. Click **Close**.

   .. Image:: /images/Local_Area_Connection_Properties_close.png

#. Click **Close** one more time to get back to the Network Manager.
   Let's leave Network Manager open for now.

   .. Image:: /images/Local_Area_Connection_Status_close.png

#. In Uniflash, enable the flashing capability by clicking on **Start
   Flashing**.

   .. Image:: /images/Uniflash_start_flashing.png

#. Depending on your Windows Firewall settings, you may get the below
   two warnings for the servers being used (opendhcp and opentftp). If
   so, please click **Allow access**.

   .. Image:: /images/Windows_Security_Alert_opendhcp.png

   .. Image:: /images/Windows_Security_Alert_opentftp.png

#. Now that the IP connection has been configured, the target board
   should request the first file from the Uniflash via TFTP over
   USB/RNDIS. This is typically the SPL or MLO file for the first stage
   of the AM335x bootloader. If you do not see a new Flash process start
   in Uniflash, you may need to power cycle the target board. This
   restart is only necessary because the driver and network set up did
   not complete quickly enough. Now that it is configured, you should be
   able to progress to the next steps.

.. image:: /images/UniFlash_status_start.png

#. Once the first file is transferred from Host to Target, it will take
   over execution on the target board from the ROM on the Sitara device.
   This will cause another instance of the USB RNDIS driver to get
   created. Windows should use the previous steps to associate the
   driver to the device and create another instance. It is easy to watch
   this process in Device Manager by watching the Network Adapters
   section. If this does not happen, and the device driver fails to
   associate properly, you'll need to use the steps above to install the
   USB driver for the new device.

#. When the second instance of the driver comes up, the new network
   interface will need to be configured like we did above. **Open the
   Network Connection and Sharing Center, if it is not already open.**

   .. Image:: /images/Open_network_sharing_center.png

#. Inside the Network and Sharing Center, click on the new Internet
   Connection:

   .. Image:: /images/Local_area_connection_3.png

   **Note: The number next to the “Local Area Connection” will depend on
   the number of network connections the computer has. If this is the
   only network connection (i.e. the computer does not have an Ethernet
   or wireless networking connection), then this would be “1”. In most
   cases, computers have either a wired or wireless connection that will
   take up spot #1. Therefore, the new USB RNDIS Network Connection will
   be #3. However, if the computer has multiple connections already,
   then this number could be higher. Each new USB connection can
   increment this number.**

#. In the Connection Dialog, **Click** on **Properties**.

   .. Image:: /images/Local_Area_Connection_3_Properties.png

#. Select **Internet Protocol Version 4 (TCP/IPv4)** and choose
   **Properties**.

   .. Image:: /images/Tcpipv4_properties.png

#. Set the port to use a Static IP Address by selecting **Use the
   following IP Address:** and changing the **IP Address:** to
   192.168.2.1. This setting should correspond to the **Network
   Interface IP** setting in Uniflash. Verify that the **Subnet Mask**
   is set to 255.255.255.0 and click **OK**.

   .. Image:: /images/Ip_address.png

   **Note: It is possible to use other IP addresses. However, the IP
   address used needs to match the Uniflash configuration. If you prefer
   to use another address, you will need to change those configurations
   as well.**

#. Click “No” if asked to remove other static configurations. Since we
   are using the same IP address for both RNDIS connections, Windows is
   trying to let us know that this is generally not a good idea.
   However, in this situation, the configuration ensures that both
   interfaces won’t be used at the same time.

   .. Image:: /images/Microsoft_TCP_IP.png

#. Click **Close**.

   .. Image:: /images/Local_Area_Connection_Properties_close.png

#. Click **Close** one more time to get back to the Network Manager.

   .. Image:: /images/Local_Area_Connection_Status_close.png

#. Now that everything is configured, the process should be able to
   complete. Take a look at Uniflash and you should see the process
   progressing forward. If not, it might be necessary to start the
   process fresh by power cycling the Target Board. With everything set
   up correctly on the Host PC at this point, the process should be able
   to proceed without issue.

.. image:: /images/UniFlash_status_start.png

|  Until it completes:

.. image:: /images/UniFlash_status_done.png

#. When the flash process is complete, simply disconnect the target
   board. It should be flashed and ready for further testing.

#. To flash another target board, simply make a connection between it
   and the Host PC by plugging a new powered target board into the USB
   cable. The board should start flashing automatically if powered and
   connected properly.
   **Note: This process is tedious to set up the first time. However,
   once the Host PC is configured properly, programming new boards is as
   simple as plugging them in and flashing them.**

.. rubric:: USB Flash Programming Notes
   :name: usb-flash-programming-notes

-  The USB/RNDIS set up is specific to each port on a given computer. If
   you follow the process above using one specific port, only that port
   is set up. If you plug a target board into a different port, the
   above process will need to be completed for that new port. Therefore,
   it is best to use the same USB port to avoid having to duplicate set
   ups.
-  Uniflash v3.0 only supports programming one board at a time using
   USB.
-  If you have trouble with RNDIS reporting problems in Device Manager,
   it mihgt be necessary to delete the RNDIS Driver and follow the above
   steps again to re-install it.
-  For this entire process to work, there has to be two USB devices
   associated and each of them need to have their network addresses set
   up correctly. Essentially, at different steps in the process, the USB
   connected target board looks differently to Windows and it needs to
   have a driver and network set up for each. You can check this using
   Device Manager for USB and Network Manager for networking.
